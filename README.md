# devops-project-simplilearn
capstone project for devops course in simplilearn.

Background Story:
"You are a DevOps engineer at EasyPay, and your company is 
developing an online platform where users add money to their 
wallet accounts and do online shopping.
EasyPay is a popular payment application, but the company is 
facing an issue in its payment success rate. The timeout that 
occurs with the connectivity of the database server has several 
downtime instances at irregular intervals.
Youâ€™re supposed to build a DevOps infrastructure for an 
application to run on the high-availability mode by creating a 
server on EC2 and implementing the network policies to allow the 
traffic from the front-end application pod. 
Hence the app can be more reliable, fast, and secure for the 
payment process."

In this project, I will be using Ansible, AWS, and Kubernetes to deploy a application along with a load balancer.
